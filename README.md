simple 12hr and 24hr clock


In this project I built a simple clock that outputs the systems time in both a 12hr and 24hr format.

I did a good job of researching how to implement the system's clock and then overall building a minimal structure of code to display the code according to directions given.

This program only outputs to the console, which isn't very useful as a program, it could output to a window and have a more intuitive UI to adjust the time and give live updates to the time.

Originally I did find this project challenging since I had zero experience implementing the systems clock in any language before.  A go to problem solver for me is heading over to stack overflow to see how others have implemented the system clock in their code before and come up with a piece of code similar to theirs, but something tailored to my project.

Overall the ability to quickly research a problem and achieve the end result in a small amount of time.

I did a poor job of commenting, so I could definitely add some comments so I or anyone could go back and read over the code and see comments to easily visualize what the little bits of code are accomplishing.
